Astro. Mostly.

- TODO: better draft support, where I don't need to copy files between obsidian vaults

  - drafts should be backed up somehow (git, or syncthing)
  - drafts shouldn't be publicly available, though they could be privately available (eg at a non crawlable unguessable url but not on front page or in indexes?)
  - drafts shouldn't be on a public github
  - publish datetime should be accurate to publish date (don't prefil when starting draft, fill at end)

- TODO: dark mode
- TODO: `inline code` styled to have the font the right size (it's too big)
- TODO: both dark and light mode support for Alabaster code theme
- TODO: replace floats on homepage with flexbox
- TODO: fix relative styled headers on homepage (maybe resume too): see google lighthouse for those pages
- TODO: footer with copyright?
