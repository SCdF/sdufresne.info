          <h3>Sanremo, A Recent Personal Project</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/scdf/sanremo">Sanremo</a> is a React / Redux / MUI based offline first web app,
            written in JS / TS. It uses PouchDB on the front end and a combination of custom sync code and socket.io to
            push data to a postgresql db on the backend.
          </p>
          <p>Sanremo has a few goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Build a simple tool that lets me easily create repeatable checklists, inspired by the use of aviation
              checklists by pilots
            </li>
            <li>
              Be an excuse to write something non trivial using some tech that I hadn't had a chance to use
              professionally
            </li>
            <li>Investigate some performance and stability issues between PouchDB adapters</li>
            <li>
              Practice <a href="https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html">coding with my voice</a>, as an rsi mitigation
              strategy

          <h3>Medic, The Last Five Years</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://medic.org/">Medic</a>&#39;s work is almost entirely open source: code, PRs, tickets and
            many design documents (if linked in tickets) are available. The bulk is against the
            <a href="https://github.com/medic/cht-core">medic/cht-core</a> repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cht-core is the core framework of the
            <a href="https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/">Community Health Toolkit</a>: a responsive offline-first web
            app designed to run on cheap android phones, a back-end api that supports it, and a back-end message
            processing engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            For <a href="https://github.com/medic/cht-core/graphs/contributors">code contributions</a>, you can see
            <a href="https://github.com/medic/cht-core/commits?author=SCdF">a list of my branch merges here</a>. Note
            that Medic employs a deliberately restrictive merge to master policy. All testing, rework, design discussion
            etc happens in a branch, with a squashed merge to master indicating that the feature or fix is complete and
            ready for production. This policy, combined with squashing merges, results in a cleaner (but sparser!)
            commit log.

        <h3>2015-2020: Senior Software Developer &amp; Engineering Manager @ Medic (UK remote)</h3>
        <p>
          <i
            ><a href="https://medic.org/">Medic</a> is a non-profit that &quot;designs, delivers, and supports
            world-class, open-source software for health workers providing care in the world’s hardest-to-reach
            communities.&quot;</i
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>senior software developer, later also the engineering manager</li>
          <li>worked remotely, collaborating with co-workers in a dozen different time-zones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As <strong>senior software developer</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            responsible for maintaining and improving a complex and highly configurable application with severe design,
            performance and user education constraints, often as part of a very small dev team, supporting tens of
            thousands of users with millions of monthly interactions in 16 countries
          </li>
          <li>
            responsible for design, coding, PR reviews, planning and scheduling, etc, from conception to production
          </li>
          <li>
            travelled to Uganda, Kenya and Nepal, working with local team mates and users to make sure the software
            accommodated their unique situations
          </li>
          <li>
            worked as a cross-discipline adviser and technical liaison on over a dozen internal projects concurrently,
            keeping track of the problems they were trying to solve and advising and directing from a core product
            perspective
          </li>
          <li>
            engineering work is a team effort, but here are some recent efforts I was deeply involved in:
            <ul>
              <li>
                replaced entire deployment toolchain with entirely new (but backwards compatible) tools, solving oodles
                of bugs and reduced deployment downtime exponentially.
              </li>
              <li>
                built (initially via a week-long in-person TDD exercise) a low impact and intentionally replaceable
                telemetry solution that solved the immediate problems we had, overcoming hesitancy and complexity around
                off the shelf solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                a feature that let custom deployers configure dynamic, programmatic but safe data integrations with
                external services. Configurable with JSON / JS, it let you write expressions or code to send data
                externally and safely, allowing for custom configurations to not rely on core development to move at
                their pace
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As <strong>engineering manager</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ran people management for the dev team, and people management and team leadership of the devops and QA teams
          </li>
          <li>
            Managed about a dozen engineers (1v1s, quarterlies, annual reviews, adhoc technical and personal support),
            while also continuing to contribute software engineering work
          </li>
          <li>Mentored junior developers through extensive one-on-one pairing, often daily and at their convenience</li>
          <li>
            Brought effective backlog management to the devops and QA teams. This enabled devops to finally clear their
            exploding support backlog, more reliably provide timely support going forward, and find time to work on
            improving core infrastructure
          </li>
          <li>
            Led a large engineering hiring round (and co-ran others): designed the take home coding exercise, reviewed
            hundreds of CVs, dozens of take home results, and performed a dozen or so interviews with candidates.
          </li>
