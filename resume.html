            </li>
            <li>
              Responsible for the Customer team, building OVO's first organisation-wide Customer API, to bridge the
              dozen or so customer entity representations and decouple the company from its legacy systems, enabling the
              company to ask such questions as <i>&quot;how many customers do we have?&quot;</i> :-)
            </li>
            <li>
              Domain driven design, sanity layering to manage complex legacy systems, ADRs to standardise approaches

                  An important journey that processes 10s of thousands of pounds a week, integrates with less robust

                <li>
                  NodeJS deployed to AWS Lambda to optimise for "fast enough" cost efficient compute, using SQS to

                <li>
                  Highly reliable, with only one notable production fault in 2 years (bad terraform merge). So reliable
                  we have been able to backfill and restore data multiple times when the less robust third party failed

          <h3>(2020-2021) Personal Growth: Voice Coding</h3>
          <p>
            Worked on mitigating my RSI. A constant niggle throughout my career, I decided it was time to fix it once
            and for all. After trying different strategies, I've landed on coding by voice, via the astonishingly
            effective
            <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talon combined with <a href="https://github.com/pokey/cursorless-talon">Cursorless</a> (incredibly fast
            structural editing) and <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a> (vim bindings for your browser) is a
            remarkably effective toolset for hands-free computing, as least as far as web browsing and coding is
            concerned.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put it to the test, I built
            <a href="#sanremo-work-sample">Sanremo</a>, an experiment in repeatable checklists by way of an
            offline-first PWA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still use my hands frequently, but voice coding means I am not required to, and voice coding is often
            faster (seriously!).
