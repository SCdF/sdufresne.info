          <h3>(2022-present) Principal Engineer @ OVO</h3>
          <p>
            <i
              ><a href="https://ovoenergy.com/">OVO</a> is a UK energy supplier, with a mission to &quot;Power human
              progress with clean affordable energy for everyone.&quot;</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Currently,</b> in the "Core Tech Energy" (CTE) platform group, reinventing OVO's core services. CTE is
            small group of the most senior engineers at OVO, focusing on high impact initiatives to reorient the company
            around API-first Domain Driven Design, setting the technical direction for the rest of the company.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Delivering OVO's first organisation-wide Customer API, to bridge the dozen or so customer entity
              representations and decouple the company from its legacy systems, enabling the company to ask such
              questions as <i>&quot;how many customers do we have?&quot;</i> :-)
            </li>
            <li>
              Delving into complex legacy systems and providing clean abstraction layers to the rest of the business
            </li>
            <li>
              Leading and contributing to ADRs to standardise approaches between dev teams, such as REST API standards,
              Data Product capture, and eventing strategies and usage
            </li>
            <li>
              Frequent collaboration with teams outside of CTE, assisting with everything from ensuring their projects
              align with company strategy, to lending principal engineer expertise to help them design their services
            </li>
            <li>Typescript backend, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Google PubSub, GraphQL, Kafka</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Previously,</b> in Zero Carbon Living (ZCL). ZCL is the domain responsible for initiatives to enable
            customers to reduce their carbon footprint.
          </p>
          <p>As principal engineer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Responsible for the technical design, coordination and mentoring of engineers working on Charge Anytime,
              OVO's smart EV charging addon
            </li>
            <li>Worked with the HoD and other principals to establish technical coherency and standards across ZCL</li>
            <li>
              Paired with other principals engineers to help them hone their designs, participating in design reviews,
              residuality theory sessions, and other architectural discussions
            </li>
            <li>Mentored and coached senior engineers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other projects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              EV Charger Installation journey
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An important journey that processes 10s of thousands of pounds a week, integrates with less robust
                  external systems, but is not traditionally considered high traffic
                </li>
                <li>
                  NodeJS deployed to AWS Lambda to optimise for "fast enough" cost efficient compute, using SQS to
                  create a fault tolerance between lambdas, and between external systems and our processing, with data
                  archived to BigQuery via Kafka autocapture
                </li>
                <li>
                  Highly reliable, with only one notable production fault in 2 years (bad terraform merge). So reliable
                  we have been able to backfill and restore data multiple times when the less robust third party failed
                </li>
                <li>
                  Aided third party in ensuring their webhook interface was secure, helping them design a message
                  signing strategy
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Smart Thermostats shipping provider automation
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rescued the project to automate shipping, as unclear historic designs, legacy systems, confusing
                  external APIs and tight deadlines meant the project was in danger of collapsing a large planned
                  marketing push
                </li>
                <li>
                  Redesigned the multiple existing attempts to produce a single scalable solution that allowed the
                  marketing push to go ahead, resulting in a <b>20x increase</b> in sales
                </li>

            <li>Proactively worked on mitigating my RSI</li>
            <li>
              I learnt how to effectively use hands-free computing as a complete keyboard replacement, building

          <p>
            I still use my hands frequently, but voice coding means I am not required to, and voice coding is often
            faster.
